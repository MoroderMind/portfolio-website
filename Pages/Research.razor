                        My research in medical AI focuses on developing algorithms that can assist healthcare professionals
                        in making more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions. I am particularly interested in:

                    <p>
                        In the field of recommender systems, I explore methods to provide more personalized and relevant
                        recommendations to users. My research interests include:

                            content-based filtering, and knowledge-based methods for improved recommendations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Context-Aware Recommendation:</strong> Incorporating contextual information 
                            (time, location, user state) to enhance recommendation relevance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Deep Learning for Recommendations:</strong> Applying neural network architectures 
                            to capture complex patterns in user-item interactions.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Fairness and Diversity:</strong> Ensuring recommendation systems provide fair 
                            and diverse suggestions rather than reinforcing existing biases.
